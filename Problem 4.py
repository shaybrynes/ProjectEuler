---*** THE PROBLEM ***---
A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

---*** SOLUTION NOTES ***---
Produce a list of all 6 digit palindromic numbers,
then create a list of the products of all 3 digit numbers that produce a palindromic number.
sort and select the largest.
